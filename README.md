 <h3>Create a Virtual Machine</h3>
 
 <p>
 Search for a Virtual machine from  the Azure marketplace. Scroll down to find the "Image" option and select "Windows 10 Pro, Version 22H2, x64 Gen2." Ensure the virtual machine has at least 2 vCPUs and 16 GB of memory, which you can set in the "Size" option on the same page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Virtual Machine Name:</strong> osticket-vm
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Username:</strong> labuser

</p>
<h3>Log into the VM with Remote Desktop</h3>
 <p>On your pc click inside the search and type "remote desktop connection". Once the connection screen opens up you will need to go to the Azure VM and copy the VM's IP address and paste it into the field that says "Computer". Then you will use the username and  password you entered for the VM when you created it. This will allow you you to control the VM from your personal PC.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>MySQL Database:</strong> osTicket</li>
  <li><strong>MySQL Username:</strong> root</li>
  <li><strong>MySQL Password:</strong> root</li>
</ul>
Important Security Note: Using "root" as both the MySQL username and password is extremely insecure and should never be done in a production environment. For development or testing on a local, isolated machine, it might be acceptable, but for anything accessible over a network, you must create a dedicated MySQL user with limited privileges and a strong, unique password.
